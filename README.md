#### A bit more about me
My favourite song changes all the time, and I listen to all kinds of music but mostly rap and pop. 
My favourite movie is 'IT', I love horror movies. But my favourite actor is Dylan O'brien. 
My favourite food is pizza because I'm a super picky eater but I've just always loved pizza more than any other food. 
![My favourite animal is dogs](https://www.petful.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/french-bulldog.jpg)I've always loved them more than anything. 
My greaest strength is that I always get stuff done on time and my greatest weakness is that I'm addicted to my phone. 
I speak english and  French and have been in french immersion all my life. 
On the weekends and weeknights I like to watch netflix and hang out with friends.
My favourite joke is "how many emo kids does it change a lightbulb? None because they sit in the dark and cry" 
With my experience in BTT10 I hope to learn how to do basic coding. A software I've used in the past is Khan Academy.
